# LaTeX-drawio-docker
This repository contains a docker image which can be used for building LaTeX projects.
The docker image contains a TeXLive-full installation (without docs and language packs, beside english and german).
It also conatins a installation of drawio which can be used to build pdf files from `*.drawio` files.

## Usage
To pull the latest version of this image use `docker pull ghcr.io/tobiweisss/latex-drawio:latest`

To simplify the usage the usage the container introduces the `latex-build` command to automatically build `<your-file>.drawio.pdf` from ever `<your-file>.drawio` in the specified directory. After that the script calls `latexmk -pdf` for building all the `*.tex` files.

Following Options are available: </br>
    -h, --help:     Show the help message </br>
    -d, --dir:      Specify the input directory to search for `*.tex` and `*.drawio` files. Default is the current directory</br>
    -c, --clean:    Clean up all auxiliary files </br>

## Intended use with LaTeX-Workshop in a VS Code devcontainer
If you want to use this image in combination with the [Visual Studio Code LaTeX Workshop extension](https://github.com/James-Yu/LaTeX-Workshop) you can use the devcontainer provided in [examples/.devcontainer/](examples/.devcontainer/). This devcontainer is configured to build your LaTeX project using the provided script, when you click on `build` or press `Ctrl + Alt + B`. In the LaTex Workshop extension you can find two new recipes called `latex-build üê±‚òï` to build the project using `latex-build` and a `latex-build-clean üê±‚òï` recipe to build the project and clean up afterwards using `latex-build -c`.<br>
This setup allows you to build and edit your LaTeX projects on every machine running Docker and VS Code.
